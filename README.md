Files for the APM Stack, Telegraf, InfluxDB, Grafana

## Config for Telegraf and InfluxDB
These are just the final versions of the ones I used to
create the Full Demo version.

## PHP Read Files
PHP-file-demo is a set of files to just throw in data about
how long a file takes to be "processed". This processing is
faked by randomizing a sleep and reading a number from the
data folders. There is not sanitizing of inputs, this is just
a mechanism to throw exec times into a UDP localhost endpoint.
